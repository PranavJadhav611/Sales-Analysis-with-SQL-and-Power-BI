# Sales Analysis with SQL and Power-BI
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL through the execution of diverse activities involving dataset manipulation and preparation. 
The ultimate aim is to refine the datasets, rendering them conducive for subsequent utilization in Power BI for advanced visualization purposes.

## About the Project
In this project, a sales database was employed, and a series of SQL operations were executed on specific datasets extracted from the sales database. The objective was to generate 
a comprehensive analysis report on sales, necessitating the application of various SQL techniques. Subsequently, the obtained results were saved for subsequent analysis through the 
visualization tool Power BI.


##  Objective Requirements list from client

* Our objective is to enhance the quality of sales reports by transitioning from static reports to dynamic visual dashboards.
* The emphasis is on detailing the quantity and types of products sold, the associated clientele, and the temporal evolution of these sales.
* Considering the distinct product and customer portfolios managed by each salesperson, it would be advantageous to incorporate filtering mechanisms
  allowing specific analysis for individual sales representatives.
* We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.
* The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.


## Tasks performed in SQL

  1) Loading the database in our MS SQL server
  2) Selecting the required datasets and performing various operations to get our desired results (tables for Power BI)
  3) Saving all results for visualizing it in Power BI.

## Tasks performed in Power BI
  1) Imported all the datasets saved with SQL along with the Budget.csv file required for our analysis.
  2) Created multiple measures.
  3) Created dedicated pages for overall overview, custormer details and product details.
  4) Below are snapshots of my Power BI model and analysis.
